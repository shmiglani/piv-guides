### Types of Certificates on your PIV card
Your PIV card contains four types of digital certificates:

-   Authentication Certificate used to log you on to applications and computers. 
This certificate usually has an -A after your name.

-   Encryption Certificate used to encrypted email messages send to you. 
This certificate usually has an -E after your name.

-   Signing Certificate used to digatally sign emails and documents. 
This certificate usually has an -S after your name.

-   Card Management Certificate. 
This certificate is issued to PIV or PIV Users.

The new 128K PIV Cards may also contain up to five of your prior encryption certificates to make it easier for you to read old encrypted emails. These certificates will have older expiration dates and may, or may not, have an -E after your name.

{% include alert-info.html content="Note: If you have a 64K PIV card, or need to read very old encrypted emails, you will need to recover the old certificates and associated keys used to encrypt them." %}
